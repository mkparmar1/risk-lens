## 🚀 Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 📦 Deployment

This project includes a `vercel.json` configuration and is ready to deploy on Vercel.

**IMPORTANT NOTE ON DATA PERSISTENCE:**
This application currently uses a file-based database (`data/db.json`). Vercel and similar serverless platforms have ephemeral file systems, meaning **data saved during a session will be lost** when the server sleeps or redeploys.

**For Production Use:**
1. Switch to a cloud database (e.g., Vercel Postgres, MongoDB Atlas, Supabase).
2. Update `lib/storage.ts` to connect to the external database.
